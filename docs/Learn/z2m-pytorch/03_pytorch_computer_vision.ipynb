    "## 2. Prepare DataLoader\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we've got a dataset ready to go.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to prepare it with a [`torch.utils.data.DataLoader`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.Dataset) or `DataLoader` for short.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `DataLoader` does what you think it might do.\n",
    "\n",
    "It helps load data into a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "For training and for inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns a large `Dataset` into a Python iterable of smaller chunks. DataLoader所做的事情就是将数据分成小批次的输入到模型中，那么为什么需要batch呢？\n",
    "\n",
    "These smaller chunks are called **batches** or **mini-batches** and can be set by the `batch_size` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do this? 下面回答了问题\n",
    "\n",
    "Because it's more computationally efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an ideal world you could do the forward pass and backward pass across all of your data at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "But once you start using really large datasets, unless you've got infinite computing power, it's easier to break them up into batches.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also gives your model more opportunities to improve. \n",
    "\n",
    "With **mini-batches** (small portions of the data), gradient descent is performed more often per epoch (once per mini-batch rather than once per epoch).因为每次不同的batch都会更新参数，因此mini-batches有更多的参数更新机会，可能更有利于模型训练。\n",
    "\n",
    "What's a good batch size?\n",
    "\n",
    "[32 is a good place to start](https://twitter.com/ylecun/status/989610208497360896?s=20&t=N96J_jotN--PYuJk2WcjMw) for a fair amount of problems. 推荐以32为batch_size，但它也是一个可训练的超参数。\n",
    "\n",
    "But since this is a value you can set (a **hyperparameter**) you can try all different kinds of values, though generally powers of 2 are used most often (e.g. 32, 64, 128, 256, 512).\n",
    "\n",
    "![an example of what a batched dataset looks like](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning/main/images/03-batching-fashionmnist.png)\n",
    "*Batching FashionMNIST with a batch size of 32 and shuffle turned on. A similar batching process will occur for other datasets but will differ depending on the batch size.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create `DataLoader`'s for our training and test sets. DataLoaer可以完成的事情很多，不过主要关注数据加载和并行处理这两项。"
